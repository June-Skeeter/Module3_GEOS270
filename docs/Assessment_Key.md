# Module Quiz (30pts)

All quiz answers are multiple choice, numeric input, fill in the blank, etc. type questions.  They can be submitted via the Module 1 Quiz that can be found on the Canvas page.  You will have unlimited attempts to take the quiz.

## Content

Half Pts:  



### [QC11](Content_Part2.md#qc11)

# Module Assignment (70 pts)

All written answers should be numbered and record in one document, saved as a .pdf, and uploaded to canvas.  The file submissions should also be saved as .pdf and uploaded as a separate document.  **Written answers can be as brief as you want as long as they answer the question.**


## Content

### [WC1](Content_Part2.md#qc1) - 10 pts
Briefly, explain the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised classification methods.

- With supervised classification, the user either explicitly defines the class boundaries, or provides a training dataset with defined classes and has the system learn the boundaries.  When we define the classes, sometimes were at risk for inducing our own bias.

- With unsupervised classification, the user *generally* picks the number of classes (some advanced methods can do this this part too, but I don't expect them to mention that) and then the system defines the classes from there. - Not truly "unsupervised" because its not like the computer just spontaneously classifies things, we have to initiate and guide the process.

## Application

### [WA1](Application_Part1.md#wa1) - 10pts
Do you think this kind of information (locations of restaurants, groceries, etc.) might be helpful when studying the cost of food in a region?

- I'm looking for them to say something involving critical thought - ie. proximity to groceries (>travel distance = >cost$), >#groceries = >choice, etc.

### [WA2](Application_Part1.md#wa2) - 10pts
Which projection did are choose for the feature dataset?  Why did I choose this projection?

-BC Albers Equal Area - Equal Area because we're calculating **Population Dentistry**, BC Albers because its specific to BC


### [WA3](Application_Part2.md#wa3) - 10pts
Skim the Introduction of the [Documentation](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction) explaining the classification scheme.  What was the reasoning behind updating from the old Rural/Urban method?

- The old urban class treated a small town of 1000 the same as a city of 1,000,000 - they needed a finer resolution classification because 2 groups was insufficient to distinguish given the scale of difference.

### [WA4](Application_Part3.md#wa4) - 10pts
Create Scatter Plot with Population Density on the X-Axis and Income_on_Food on the Y axis.  Does the r2 score indicate a relationship?  How does classifying the data help us reveal patterns in the data we cant easily see in the scatter plot?

- The scatterplot does not show a strong relationshp.  Classifiying the highlights the relationship better, by specifically grouping census subdivisions using two factors: total population **and** population density.  It allows us to see that cities have a close spread in the same range.  It also shows that while not all rurlal area are impacted by food affordability issues, all of the worst affected areas **are** rural.

## File Submissions

### [FA1](Application_Part3.md#fa1) - 10pts each (20pts total)
Submit your Bar Chart and Box Plot to Canvas.

- Must use colorscheme that is red-green colorblind friendly [see this video for reference on what I've told them](https://youtu.be/3Kf0Ng3ZVBs?t=687) **&** suitable for qualitative data (not a sequential colormap)

- Should have meaningful concise labels (edit out underscores, etc.) & generally be aesthetically pleasing.
