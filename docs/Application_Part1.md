Once you're setup, you can download the data.  The video below walks you through using the simply analytics interface.  We are going to download the following data: **Total Population (2021)**, **Median Household Income (2021)**, and **Average Total Expenditures on Food (2021)**.  

The steps outlined in the video are:

**1**{: .label .label-blue } Create your project to query data.

* Select study area and inspect default variables.
* Explore the interface.
* Watch intro video on Simply Analytics.

**2**{: .label .label-blue } Query additional variables.

* Search for food cost.
* Make sure to select the correct variable.

**3**{: .label .label-blue } Export the data.

* Save the project so its easy to come back if needed.
* Export the shapefile.
	* Make sure all variables are checked.
	* Make sure to export **Census Subdivisions**.


**4**{: .label .label-blue } Import the Data.

* Check your email for the download link.  Extract the Simply Analytics shapefile to the **Module3/Current_Year_Estimate** folder.

### QA1

Simply Analytics allows you to download data about businesses locations. [T/F]

### WA1

Do you think this kind of information (locations of restaurants, groceries, etc.) might be helpful when studying the cost of food in a region?

# Pre-Processing

We have to do a few things to the data to make sure everything setup and ready so we can conduct our analysis.

The steps outlined in the video are:

**1**{: .label .label-green } Make sure the data is in the proper projection!

* Import the census data into the project feature dataset.
	* Think about what projection we're using and **why**.
* Rename the variables.
	* Data from simply analytics comes with generic column headers that can be confusing.
	* The simply analytics data comes with a text file containing header names you can reference to give them more helpful names.


**3**{: .label .label-green } Clip the census subdivisions by the BC boundary file.

* The census subdivision from Simply Analytics look pretty funky along the coast.
	* We can use the **Clip** tool to cut the layer down to size.
	* Think about what projection we're using and **why**
* Rename the variables
	* Data from simply analytics comes with generic column headers that can be confusing
	* The simply analytics data comes with a text file containing header names you can reference to give them more helpful names

<!-- 
### QA2

We used the clip tool to ensure we don't  ____ population density in the coastal Subdivisions.

### WA2

Which projection did are choose for the feature dataset?  Why did I choose this projection?
