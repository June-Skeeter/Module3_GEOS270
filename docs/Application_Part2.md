# Defining Rural & Urban Areas

Until 2010, Statistics Canada used a Rural/Urban classification scheme to describe Census unit smaller than a Province/Territory:

**Rural**: a population density less than 400 people per square kilometer **or** a total population of less than 1,000 people.

**Urban**: a unit with a population density at least 400 people per square kilometer **and** a total population of at least 1,000 people.

## A Revised Classification

Statistics Canada Now uses the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification**.  You can skim the [Documentation](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction) explaining the classification scheme to get a feel for the reasoning behind updating from the old Rural/Urban method?  The new classification scheme was updated to split the old **Urban** class into three different kinds of **Population Centers**:

|**Rural**         |**Small population centers**            |**Medium population centers**                                            |**Large urban population centers**        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|Same as old method|Not Rural **and**<br>Population < 30,000|Not Rural **and**<br>Population >= 30,000 **and**<br>Population < 100,000|Not Rural **and**<br>Population >= 100,000|

# Applying the Classification

Your task is to apply the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification** scheme (see table above).  You can watch the video below for reference, which shows you how to apply the old **Urban/Rural** scheme. **Note**: You do not need to apply the old classification scheme, I use this example as a reference.  All your answers and your for the lab should be drawn from the **New** classification scheme.  The general steps for classifying the data are:


**1**{: .label .label-red } Calculate population density.

* You can refer to the exercise we did as part of [Module 1](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise4-pop-density.html) for help.


**2**{: .label .label-red } Create a field and populate it using select by attribute, following the **Population Center and Rural Area Classification** scheme.

* You can reference the table above for pointers on how to formulate your SQL statements.

<!-- ### QA3

The Select by Attribute tool lets us use SQL (Structured Query Language) to define expressions for querying vector data. [T/F] -->
